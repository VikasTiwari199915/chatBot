# chatBot[ANVI]
A Very simple chatbot made using if else :) made it during my college days so it's not very advanced...
Sololearn App for coding was very popular during that time, I used to compete and learn new things on that platform.
I was so invested in making this that I continued adding features, like YouTube video search, calculator, Bing search, news, weather, time, and more.
It became a simpler assistant than a chatbot.
